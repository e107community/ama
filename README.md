# Ask the e107help team (almost) anything!

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/e107help/ama](https://badges.gitter.im/e107help/ama.svg)](https://gitter.im/e107help/ama?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

People are bound to have questions related to the e107help community platform update. Since filling the G+ page with these questions will be difficult to track, and posting them on the [e107help.org](http://e107help.org/) website doesn't really go towards the sites intended direction -- let's try this!

If you have questions related to e107 in general send your questions to the previously mentioned site, or head on over to the [e107 repo](https://github.com/e107inc/e107)!

### Ask a question

Once you've determined that your question hasn't [already been answered](https://github.com/e107help/ama/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1]) you can ask a question simply by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/e107help/ama/issues/new) on this project.

After your question has been answered, we will close it! If you still have something to say you are more than welcome to but closing your issue allows us to keep track of which questions we've answered!

### Read past questions

Once questions are answered to the best of our knowledge by a team member they are closed. You can still read these questions by checking out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/e107help/ama/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1]). Who knows, reading these may give you an idea for another great question!
